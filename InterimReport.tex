\title{Pony - A Language for Truly Concurrent Computation}

\author{Michael Thorpe}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Concurrency is hard, really hard to get right. Shared resources require semaphores, locking and monitors which are very easy to get wrong and even these protections introduce race conditions. Even Actor-Model languages have some of the same problems, other actors can modify data and can still have data contention.

In my masters project I will focus on designing and creating a new programming language that will introduce a new kind of type system, determining mutability, immutability and uniqueness. This language will treat actors as first class members and will have several relatively unexplored features for a programming language, including no inheritance, a feature being called partial objects and ????
